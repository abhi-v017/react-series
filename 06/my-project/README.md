# currency converter
in this I created cutom hook useCurrencyInfo in which fetch data from API and export it.
- and made a component InputBox which has parameters label, amount, onAmountChange,onCurrencyChange, currencyOptions = [], selectCurrency = "", amountDisable = false,
currencyDisable = false

- label takes from or to just for heading.
- amount for taking amounnt as input.
- onAmountChange it handles the change in amount.
- onCurrencyChange it handles the change currency.
- currencyOptions it provides the list of multiple currencies as array and mapped using select and option.
- selectCurrency it handles the selected currency.
- amountDisable used to disable input of amount.
- currencyDisable used to disable input of currency.
